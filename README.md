## Getting Started
To run this repo on your local machine, clone this repo down and bundle / npm install.

## Synopsis
BrewReview is a site that reviews Philadelphia's brewpubs according to user input. Users may add their favorite brewpub for other users to review! Individual user reviews also can be upvoted and downvoted.

## Build
BrewReview uses a Ruby on Rails backend with some React.js for the frontend.

### Notable Gems
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for user authentication.
* [CarrierWave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) for image uploading.

## Motivation
We like beer and we know you do too, so come on down and submit your review!

## Testing
To run the tests for this app, running the command ```rake``` in your terminal will run all Ruby tests. Since some of the front end is using React.js, running ```karma start``` will run the Javascript tests.
